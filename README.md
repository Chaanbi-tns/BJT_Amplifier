# BJT_Amplifier
In this project we are about to study the BJT(bipolar jonction Transistor) in both the static operating mode ,to determinate the biaising  point ,and the dynamic mode to evaluate the voltage gain of the transistor and frequency bandwidth
# Objectives
With Spice we are going to:
-Understand the operating principles of the BJT amplifier
-Analysing the static operating point
-Studying the (AC) behavior of the 
-Determinate the Voltage gain
# Theory
A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a type of transistor that uses both electrons and electron holes as charge carriers.
